In our company, Team Lead's were responsible for technical direction, delivery and their direct reports. This lead to an incredible work load for the Team Leads, so we decided to experiment with implementing Team and Technical leads within the same team to combat the workload. This is how it went (from the Tech Lead's perspective).

**The previous role of the Team Lead**

All of our teams had a Team Lead. This was a developer who had moved into a management position. All the developers in a team reported to the Team Lead. This person was not only a line-manager, expected to have regular one-to-ones with everyone in their team, but also was responsible for:
 * Architecture & technical product direction (strategy).
 * Software Product delivery and co-ordination of work across the different products (tactical) - working with Product Managers.
 * Technical mentorship to improve skills & practices
 * Team & Department people-related admin

    
To put this in perspective, the Team Leads were in every meeting about work planning, updates, story creation, team logistics, recruitment, talking with users & clients, researching technology, tools & vendors, the list goes on. There were many scenarios where the Team Lead was simply not available to the team.
We had fairly large teams. My team was between 6-8 people at any time. This was a good size given that we maintained all of our own infrastructure, wrote and deployed all our own code and were on-call for everything we built.
Three Team Leads reached breaking point and resigned within a few weeks of each other.

**Introducing Tech Leads**

Clearly the stress of taking on all that responsibility caused our leaders to burn out.
The decision was made to split the line management and technical responsibilities. 
Each team would have a Technical Lead as well as a Team Lead. The Tech Lead would take on the Technical Strategy & Direction, tooling & practice oversight and, in my team, career-development work.

**Our Coach and Captain**
Our Team Lead was not a coder. They had run their own start-up for a Technical Product but were not involved in building it. In our team, this role was very much like a Coach of a team. The Team Lead 'played' in the realm of our Software Products and understood helped the products get delivered but didn't actually 'play' with the team.
They made sure to  actively listen to each person, helping with and providing advice on personal well-being and generally taking care of them within the organisation. They were a good communicator and were also experienced in business which helped the team navigate scenarios and understand priorities in the bigger context of the wider business. 
They were also a good mediator and worked with each person to improve their ability to work within a team.
The Tech Lead did 'play on the field' with the team. 
The Tech Lead sat with the team almost all week, was available for reviews, oversight, direction and judgement calls. 
Unlike the previous Team Lead who was bogged down with admin, the Tech Lead was much more available which means decisions were made, work unblocked and technical re-direction was able to happen very quickly.

**What did the team think?**
As this Team and Tech Lead worked well together, the team enjoyed the leadership configuration because they felt that their needs as people and technologists were able to be addressed.
The team's motivation and output greatly improved overall. The Tech Lead availability sped up technical work. 
For decisions that were clearly technical or not, it was clear who could assist but for those decisions that were not as clear, sometimes the other Lead needed to be consulted.
It is clear that if there is not trust between the 2 Leads, this configuration could greatly slow a team's delivery speed. Luckily in our case, this trust was in place and the 2 Lead's were highly aligned. 
As time went on, the need for consultancy between the two became less as well.

**What I learned as the Tech Lead**
I've been asked a few times if I would consider a Team Lead position but I haven't wanted to remove myself from the codebase. I very much enjoy still building software and I'm fully aware that Team Lead roles take you away from the code, at least in a mid-sized company and up (my preferred company sizes).
I've also been inside many teams where a Technical Team Lead could be absent from the team for hours and days and though a Senior Developer is perfectly capable of making a tactical decision, they may be missing context in  overall strategy (either by their choice or due to culture)
Personally I gained a lot of insight from working with someone who had more experience with the other aspects of the business. It was incredibly insightful to get feedback on how what I said was coming across, where I needed to be clearer, what certain situations truly meant (translating 'business speak').
I am a better leader for it.

**Where would you use this?**
Not all organisations would require this set-up. Certainly small organisations could benefit from a coach but your Tech Lead can probably handle Team Lead responsibilities with some training (if they don't have experience).
Mid-size (over 20 developers in my opinion) and up could certainly benefit from this set-up as the technical work demands attention and you're likely to have more associated to mid-level engineers than you are juniors (growth effect).
Also if the technical work is very demanding, it's can be very difficult for a Technical Lead to keep up with Technical Strategy, code quality and a high-level of engagement with each team member.
It's also useful:
        - in difficult teams that are not quite working well together
        - you have a talented Technical Leader but they don't want to line manage.
        - you have a immature developers who are technically gifted but need guidance on working within a team and taming their ego.
        
**What about an actual coach or Scrum master**
Having worked with Scrum masters and coaches, the immediate difference here is accountability. 
I know this can be a touchy subject but to make it simple - I haven't seen Scrum masters or coaches HAVE to jump onto work that is urgent or take responsibility for a mistake that has cost a company money or reputation.
If your favourite sports team performs badly on the field, do you let the coach off the hook?
Of course not, they are just as accountable for the team's performance as the actual team is.
Personally this leads to trust with the team - this person is everyone's line manager at the end off the day.
